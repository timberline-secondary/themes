# themes

### Instructions:

Ensure that the pi is running at least v3.9 Python.

if it is then continue with the following commands:

```bash
git pull https://github.com/timberline-secondary/themes
```

### Bootup:

all of the bootup commands are kept in `startthemes.sh` in `~` (/home/pi).

`startthemes.sh` will enter into `startup.sh` in the /themes dir (this repo) and it will run the commands in that file to start the program.
